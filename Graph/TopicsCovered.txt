2. Simple implementation - Basic implementation using ArrayList of ArrayList<Integer> with DFS and BFS printer
TO-DO
3. DFS - questions
4. BFS - questions
5. Detect cycle - in an undirected Graph - Using DFS with parent check
6. Detect cycle - in a directed Graph - Using DFS with separate recuresion stack space check
